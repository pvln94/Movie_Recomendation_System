# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using machine learning. The system leverages the TMDb (The Movie Database) dataset to provide personalized movie suggestions.

## Project Overview
The recommendation system is built with the following components:

## Data:
# tmdb_5000_movies.csv - Contains information about movies.
# tmdb_5000_credits.csv - Contains information about movie credits (cast and crew).

### Machine Learning Code:
The ML code for the recommendation system is in the Movie-Recommendation-System.ipynb file.

### Web Application:
The web interface for the recommendation system is built using Streamlit.

### Setup Instructions
To ensure that your global Python environment remains unaffected, it is recommended to use a virtual environment.

## Create and Activate Virtual Environment
python -m venv myenv 
myenv\Scripts\Activate

## Run the Streamlit Application
To start the Streamlit web application, use the following command:

streamlit run app.py
